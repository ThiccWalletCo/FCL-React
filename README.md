# Fantasy Coin League Client App
Contributers: Andrew Aslakson, Michael Chau, Cole Paris, and Heather Zrinsky

## About The Project
This web application is a crypto-trading simulator that puts users in direct competition with each other to see who can gain the most given an initial starting value. Users can create groups or "leagues" where other users can join and immediately buy and sell Coinbase-accepted cryptocurrencies. Each league has its own leaderboard for comparing users' portfolios.

The backend companion app needs to be running along with the client application.
